INTRODUCTION
------------
The most available source of energy and in a large amount is solar energy. According to a study that has been done the earth receives about 10000TW every day from solar energy. Another study has been done in 2015 to determine the energy consumption for the world. The results stated that the whole world consumes about 17.4TW.There is a gradual increase in the energy consumption of the whole world every year, this is an increase within a range of 1-1.5% it can be called annual energy growth. Depending on a calculation has been done depending on the annual growth and the energy usage, by the year 2040 there is a prediction states that the world consumption of energy is expected to increase by 56%. By comparing the expected growth in the following two decades, the current energy consumption, and the hourly solar energy achieved from the solar radiation, using this data an imagination can be built to expect the availability of solar energy. The amount of energy that the whole world uses is not a small fraction of what we achieved from solar radiation in an hour.

PROBLEM IDENTIFICATON 
---------------------

There are a lot of designing procedures for PV system sizing which leads to more complexity decrease the accuracy of the calculations and decrease the performance of the system. So, it is required to build a website to calculate the requirements which should be used in order to achieve a design can overcome the load requirements.

SOLUTION 
--------

After searching and gathering information about the previous implemented softwares for the PV designing systems it was found that a simple new PV solar website will be a good application for the PV community.
Accordingly, the main target of the research is to produce a new website for PV designing which works under the latest technologies available, can be able to import the weather conditions data from the international website, can be used by anyone, with less inputs by the user, reduce the cost of the whole designed system, and increase the performance ratio.  

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PV-TOOL
-----------------------------

1) Reduce the number of inputs by the user
2) Reduce the time taken in the designing process. 
3) Increase the accuracy of the system.
4) Gradually updated the irradiation data. 
5) Most suitable solar panels layout. 
6) Predicted economic analysis.


PV DESIGN STEPS
---------------  
First step to design any PV system whether standalone system or on grid system, there are various steps should be done to achieve a fully designed PV system. The main target of any designer is to obtain the maximum energy from the sun while reducing the cost of the whole system. The following at the main steps of each PV system designing:

1.	Calculate the load demand
2.	Sun resources and peak hours 
3.	System losses 
4.	Calculate the number and the of the panels.
5.	Specifying the battery type 
6.	Specifying the inverter 
7.	Specifying the charge controller 
8.	Economic analysis over 20 years 


CODE RUNNING SEQUENCE
---------------------

Our main target is to create a website can be used by any user who targets to build his own solar PV system depending on his location and his budget. Thus, to be able to create the website and convert the analytical equation into software codes, it is required to learn the tool which will qualify you to build your own website. At the first step when you go through the website development field, you may sense overwhelmed by the various available used languages and evaluation approaches you will face. For example, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) are widely used in different field and for various targets. Often both languages are used together in the same designed website. The designed website called SolarCo Energy is implemented to be a guideline and calculator for the PV power system used by the designer to find out the required components for the solar system

1. Load demand
2. Location Layout 
3. Panel Sizing
4. Battery Sizing 


TESTING AND VALIDATION
----------------------
After implementation of the mathematical equations in the backend which responsible to analyse the input user data and convert it into a critical information can be used in designing a complete PV solar system. The results of the website has been compared to different implemented Pv project and the accurcy of the results was about 95%. The results obtained comes in form of technical report classified into five main parts as follow. 
1. Location general parameters
2. Electrical loads
3. Panel’s specifications
4. Battery’s specifications, Inverter, and charge controller selection
5. Estimated cost analysis
